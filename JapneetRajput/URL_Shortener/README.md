# Project Title
A URL Shortener is a tool that creates a short, unique URL that will redirect to the specific website of your choosing

## Prerequisites
Modules used in this app are Flask and PyShortener(installation guide given ahead)

## Initial Setup:

**Create DB and start Server**
1. Start MySQL and Apache server from the Xampp control panel.
2. Now go to MySQL Server Admin page -> SQL.
3. Now we will initialize the database schema.
4. For this, paste the queries given in initialize.sql in the SQL window and click on go (created local DB).

#### NOTE: If you have changed the database name in the query then change it in other files too (app.py) 

**Create Config file**
1. The settings.py is going to fetch values from this file. 
2. So create a .env file in you base project folder.
3. Enter required values according to your local database and preferences.

#### NOTE: we use file types like .env as they are ignored by github on pushing to repo. This is done because it contains your local configs for your system and may contain sensitive info.
